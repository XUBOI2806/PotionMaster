# Potion Master

## Game Mechanics Overview
In "Potion Master," players engage in dynamic 3D combat using a unique potion based mechanic that serves as the core of gameplay. Each potion offers distinct advantages and can either be thrown to damage or crowd control enemies, or buff the player when consumed. This diverse arsenal ensures that gameplay remains engaging and strategically deep, appealing to players who enjoy fast-paced action and tactical decision-making. The mechanic incorporates additional elements like enemy spawners, gravity wells and traps that increase the game's challenge and complexity. The integration of these mechanics creates a gameplay experience where strategy and quick reflexes are key to mastering the art of potion warfare.

## Target Platform
"Potion Master" is designed for PC players. This choice is motivated by the advanced input options of keyboards and mice, which is crucial for a game requiring precise potion targeting and quick reflex changes. PCs also handle high-quality graphics and intensive physics calculations well, ensuring a smooth and visually appealing gameplay experience. Additionally, the widespread availability of PCs among our target demographic ensures that the prototype reaches a broad audience.
